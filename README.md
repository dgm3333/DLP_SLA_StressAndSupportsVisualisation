# DLP_SLA_StressAndSupportsVisualisation

This code was going to be a visualisation of stress and supports as a possible add-on to the excellent UVTools project (https://github.com/sn4k3/UVtools).
However one of the comments from Tiago was that it would be much easier to analyse from the original 3d mesh.
After getting a basic simulation running I then started to rewrite the code before realising that he was actually correct, so I'm switching to analysing direct in Blender using it's Python scripting engine.

Any work I do will be added to my fork of the Blender 3d-printing toolbox: https://github.com/dgm3333/3d-print-toolbox-modified
So this is a dead (and fairly pointless repo) now just for interest.
